A classic short story in English is "The Lion and the Mouse." It's about a lion that spares a mouse, and later, the same mouse saves the lion from a hunter's net. This tale illustrates the moral that even small acts of kindness can be greatly rewarded. 
The Lion and the Mouse
Once, a lion was sleeping in the jungle when a small mouse began to run over his body. The lion woke up in a hurry, caught the mouse, and was about to kill it. The mouse, terrified, begged the lion to spare its life, promising to be grateful forever. The lion found the plea amusing and let the mouse go. 
A few days later, the lion got caught in a hunter's net and was trapped. The mouse, hearing the lion's roars, came to the scene. Remembering its promise, the mouse began to chew on the ropes of the net with its sharp teeth. Soon, the lion was free. The lion thanked the mouse, and the two became friends. 
The moral of the story is that small acts of kindness will be greatly rewarded.
